# fitness-tracker
With this app, you are able to view, create and track daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You are also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
